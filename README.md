# Diagram Generator in C# and .NET 8
This project was developed as an assignment for the course "Programming in C#, III (DA208E)" at Malmö University. The primary goal of the assignment was to explore 2D graphic tools in GDI+ with Windows Forms.

## Overview
The "diagram-generator" project is a Windows Forms application designed to generate two-dimensional diagrams based on a given list of points. Key features of the application include:

- Plotting a two-dimensional diagram from user-provided points.
- Reading x and y coordinates through the UI.
- Drawing the diagram using a scale determined by the maximum x and y values specified by the user.
- Displaying the values of the coordinates for a position on the diagram when the user moves the mouse.
